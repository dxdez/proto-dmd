# Proto DMD - Django Markdown

This application is a prototype written in Django for rendering markdown files. Markdown is a plain text formatting language that can automatically convert to HTML for publishing on the Web. Due to its accessible syntax and widespread use in static site generators, productivity apps, and content management tools, itâ€™s become a popular alternative to rich-text editors for both technical and non-technical content creators.
